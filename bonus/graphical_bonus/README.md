<h1 align="center">🔥 Graphical CoreWar 🔥</h1>

> Corewar is a game. A very special game. It consists of pitting little programs against one another in a virtual machine.  
> The goal of the game is to prevent the other programs from functioning correctly by using all available means.  
> The game will, therefore, create a virtual machine in which the programs (written by the players) will face off.  
> Each program’s objective is to “survive”, that is to say executing a special instruction ("live") that means I’m still alive.  
> These programs simultaneously execute in the virtual machine and in the same memory zone, which enables them to write on one another.  
> The winner of the game is the last one to have executed the "live" instruction.
